## CATEGORY 1: THE ESEC EVALUATION MODEL

### How can I use the eSEC evaluation tool (use cases)?

- eSEC can be used to assess existing documents (already issued and in circulation) or future ones (projects of modernisation). Or even purely fictitious documents (e.g. marketing samples used for demos, which – we should have this in mind – are not always intended to be fully representative of a real potential document)
- eSEC can be used by many populations: document examination experts; document designers; project management teams... within different organizations: issuing authorities; law enforcement bodies; international organisations involved in capacity building (e.g. training on how documents are made); document manufacturers and suppliers to the security industry...
- eSEC can be used in the frame of a project or just to learn some basics about document security

### Who created the eSEC model, who is behind?

- back to 2918 and even before
- 2022 update

### What was the process to rank security features?

- Several experts from SIA and external contributed to find a balanced and fair consensus – we expected it to be very challenging and indeed it was.
- The ranking provides guidance, of course it has limits; because there is no perfect model
- We assume you have good quality suppliers and security features - We assume you work with good security designers when embedding the SF

### What has evolved between eSEC 1.0 (2018) and eSEC 2.0 (202X)?

- The team behind eSEC 2.0 worked on several topics
  - user experience (UX)
  - ...
  - security [we shall be careful for this topic]
- eSEC was developed with the valuable support of document security experts working for law enforcement, issuing authoties... or as independant consultants.

### How often is the model updated?

- We know that document fraud is evolving every day; and new security features are made available also regularly
- We have the ambition to update the model on a yearly basis, together with a group of experts
- The online tool makes it very easy to have the model evolving, changing only one parameter if needed
- With the premium version you have the possibility to add your own features, if needed; this is xxx

_SIA [answer to NTWG]: At the moment we have no process or schedule in place, but the plan is to establish
one. The current idea is to do an annual (or more frequent) update where the SIA member, the user group
and possibly other interest groups can work together._

### [asked by NTWG] Integration of security features: the tool seems more or less to “count” the number of security features. But the real value of a security feature comes from the integration into the card body or ideally with personalized data. For example – to put a laser printed personalization on top of a really good hologram is not what you want to see. So, how is the integration of the security feature being assessed in the tool?

SIA: This is indeed a complex topic and covering all the nuances of evaluating the security of a document is likely beyond any automated tool. While designing the tool, we have tried our best to cover everything, but as said it can never be perfect – the tool provides guidelines (indications) to help assessing and designing better documents. This assistance cannot replace experts know-how and decisions (similarly to Doc 9303 recommendations).

Firstly we wish to remind that we do not simply calculate the security features, but we also give different value for them depending how strong they are and how they protect against different attacks on the document. E.g. alteration of the photo. We also list security features that are done during personalization phase etc. Having a balanced set of features is already an indication that the design of the document is on the right track.

The essence of your question is likely that is the tool evaluating how intelligently the security features are used. E.g. having one security feature that protects another one, increase the value of both. Or having a security feature placed in a way that it protects the personalization instead a less valuable part of the document. We do not have anything in the tool that would be able to evaluate the design directly. But among the guidance provided, we do have the list of questions related to the design process. How it was done, who was involved, what tools were used etc. This was the level of detail we thought would be usable in an self-evaluation tool.

### [asked by NTWG] The tool seems to assess “only” physical security features. How about the chip?

SIA: The origin of the tool is the realization that there is no commonly agreed method to evaluate the physical security of the document.
We didn’t want to create anything that would compete with something that is already available andwell-established.

We didn’t want to create anything that would compete with something that is already available and
well-established.

For the chip security we felt that the standards and specifications are actually fairly straight forward
and there is very limited set of choices to make.

And that the Common Criteria methodology and the protection profiles created for the chip of most
governmental documents are covering this part very well.

**Question from SIA** Would such an answer from SIA be acceptable in the FAQ section? Otherwise, what would be the minimum the tool should enable to assess?

### [asked by NTWG] Are there weights (weighting factors) between categories, how do they influence on the score and can they be changed by the user of the software tool to accommodate his/her preferences?

SIA: There are some weights used inside the tool.

On the highest level we value the 4 main fields the tool evaluates like this:

- How widely security features are distributed across different parts of the document                15%
- How strongly the document is protected against different attacks                                                    35%
- How well different security feature levels are represented in the document                                  20%
- The design process of the overall document                                                                                              30%

There are also some weights use at lower levels of the score calculation. E.g. level 1 security features
are value more than level 2 and 3.

Currently we do not have plans to allow the user the change these rates for each evaluation they do.

However the plan is to be fully transparent on how the algorithm works and possibly changing the weights
on the tool itself during the scheduled reviews (future versions of the tool, optimized with relevant
experts – see your question about update policy).

However, allowing the user to change these weight for their own is definitely something we could add.

### [asked by NTWG] How does the tool assess features in VIS (white light), UV, and IR spectral range and the combination?

SIA: We treat all security features the same way. We categorize them and given them value against threats
and how easy it is to verify them under VIS, UV and/or IR spectral ranges (some features are multi-level,
the algorithm takes it into account).

In the current database we have e.g. the following security features:

- IR drop-out inks (in personalization)
- Infrared Drop-Out Inks
- Infrared Fluorescent Inks
- Metachromic Ink
- Multi-color visible and UV reactive fibres
- UV dull substrate material
- UV: 2 or more colors
- UV: Bi-flourescent ink
- UV: Blue
- UV: non-Blue
- UV: True color images

### [asked by NTWG] How does the tool assess features designed for optical machine authentication (see ICAO Doc 9303 Annex on OMA)?

SIA: For each feature we have a value for how easy it is to verify with different methods and on the overall
score/ranking we value that all verification methods are covered within the document. In the current
database we have Automated Border Control as one of the methods. And in the update that we are working right
now we are adding a more generic machine verification aspect.

### Can I chose a target to be reached (global scoring after evaluating a given document)?

YES

### How can I know if my document is ICAO compliant?

- the tool offers some guidance
- currently limited to Doc 9303, part 2 (physical security features for travel documents)
- link to other reference documentation
- eSEC 2.0 was designed with the collaboration of NTWG (author of the Doc 9303)
- disclaimer: eSEC provides guidelines and doesn’t replace a deeper analysis by a specialist of Doc 9303
  (members of SIA can help if needed)

### [asked by NTWG] What is exactly considered (assessed) when stating ICAO 9303 compliance? What about EU2252/2004 compliance (minimum security standards for Eu passports – similar important but not identical)?

SIA: Our plan is that you can add these compliancy verification options into the tool in the future. This is
something that the user can then choose to do (or not) against the standard of their choice. We have
identified several possible standards that we could add. However, none of them are implemented at this time.
The two you mentioned are among the few priorities, collaboration with NTWG will help.

### [asked by NTWG] How do you deal with comparable features (e.g. DID (by Hologram Industries) vs RICS (by OVD Kinegram)?

SIA: We avoid referring directly to any suppliers products, but instead describe the security feature in a
generic way.

If there is a way to distinguish them technically or functionally we do it. E:g. the UV-colors in the
earlier question.

We do recognize that there are products of varying quality and security available in the market that
easily fall with the same specification.

But despite this we do not value one suppliers product over another one as it is very difficult to do
objectively.

What we do plan to do is explain the model and give recommendations. E.g. the model is assuming that all
the security features selected are of good quality.

While we will also highlight that selecting a lower quality feature as one of the central security feature
is likely to impact your security despite the value given by the tool.

**Again, we hope this kind of explanation will be acceptable in the FAQ section.**

### [asked by NTWG] Coming back to the EU regulation EU 2252/2004 which is binding law for all EU 26. There the minimum security requirements are divided into categories: material (substrate), security printing, copy protection, personalization and numbering. Security features have to be in all those areas. How about using this structure in the tool?

SIA: At the moment we are not doing exactly the same, but there are great similarities in the spirit of the
regulation and the tool.

E.g. most of the categories listed there have a direct equivalent in the eSEC tools location for security
features.

And the tool is verifying that you have a good set of features in each location. While the copy protection
is close to one of the 11 threats we check.

Our tool needs to work with all document and regulations and to establish this we are often going into more
details than the regulations.

**Question from SIA**: Who do you think we should talk with when it comes to this
EU 2252/2004 regulation (so the tool makes it easier to ensure compliancy)?

### [asked by NTWG] How about comparability? I.e., if you give the same (specimen) document to, say, 5 different testers (ideally of the similar level of expertise/training) – would they come up with the same/similar result?

SIA: That is the goal. And to achieve it, we will need to be clear on the naming and descriptions inside the
tool (i.e. short names + longer description of features when users scroll on the name). Our early adopter
user group will play with the prototype, it will help to verify if they do get similar results.

### Can I create and add my own security features?

this will depend on the version: basic (nok) or premium (ok)

### What about the cost of the security features (which has an impact on the cost of documents)?

- the eSEC model doesn’t mention that, which would be nearly impossible to ~modelize (for example, the cost
  of features like security paper, DOVIDs and microchips can vary a lot according to the quantity ordered by
  document manufacturers)
- in addition, SIA members are not allowed to talk about prices between them
- of course, SIA members can provide information on their own, you can consult any of them according to
  their specialities

## CATEGORY 2: BASIC AND PREMIUM VERSIONS/FEATURES

### What are the differences between basic and premium versions?

Here is a table with the available functionalities **[insert once table ready]**

### How many different documents can I create with my account?

it depends on the version of eSEC you use (basic or premium) **[insert once table ready]**

## CATEGORY 3: SECURITY AND PRIVACY

### Where is the data (hosting) and who can access it?

- hosting = xxx **[we must provide guarantees]**
- data stored online is fully encrypted; it means xxx
- this global security has been audited by xxx [! There will be a cost if we want the solution to be
  audited], a guarantee of data security

### How long will the data remain in the database?

To be defined

### How can I extract the data?

To be defined

To be defined

## CATEGORY 4: OTHER

### How can I know what are the security features used on existing documents?

- if you don’t have a physical specimen in your hands, you can use the reference databases.
- some of these are public (open free consultation) and provide basic information
- some require special rights to access to some level of information (i.e. high quality images, security
  features and details demanding a real “need to know”...). In general, they are only available to some
  populations (typically, law enforcement experts).
- links toward open databases (e.g. Edison TD and PRADO)
- some are available with a yearly subscription
- testing Keesing Documentchecker is for free
